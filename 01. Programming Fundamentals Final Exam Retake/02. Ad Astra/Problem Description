On the first line of the input, you will be given a text string. You must extract the information about the food and calculate the total calories. 
First, you must extract the food info. It will always follow the same pattern rules:
•	It will be surrounded by "|" or "#" (only one of the two) in the following pattern: 
#{item name}#{expiration date}#{calories}#   or 
|{item name}|{expiration date}|{calories}|
•	The item name will contain only lowercase and uppercase letters and whitespace
•	The expiration date will always follow the pattern: "{day}/{month}/{year}", where the day, month, and year will be exactly two digits long
•	The calories will be an integer between 0-10000
Calculate the total calories of all food items and then determine how many days you can last with the food you have. Keep in mind that you need 2000kcal a day.
